        Print this help document.
    -p, --persist

EXAMPLES
    - Print the current battery charging threshold.

        $ bat --threshold
    
    - Set a new charging threshold, say of 80%. This usually requires superuser
      permissions.

        $ sudo bat --threshold 80
    
    - Persist the current charging threshold setting between restarts. This also
      usually requires superuser permissions.

        $ sudo bat --persist
