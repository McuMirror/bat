# How to Contribute to `bat`

## Before You Start Contributing Code

We welcome contributions to the `bat` project, but it's important to coordinate your efforts properly. Here's what you should do before you begin:

**Discuss significant changes.** If you plan to make a significant change to the project, it's a good idea to discuss it first. You can do this by opening a [discussion](https://github.com/tshakalekholoane/bat/discussions) or by [creating an issue](https://github.com/tshakalekholoane/bat/issues/new/choose) to signal your intention.

**Open an issue for new problems.** Unless your change is very minor, it should be connected to an existing issue. Feel free to open a new issue and discuss your plans there. This helps ensure that your idea aligns with the project's goals, avoids duplication of work, and allows others to provide input.

**Commit messages.** If your contribution is accepted, your commits will be combined into a single commit, and the commit description will be generated from your pull request's title and description. When writing commit messages, follow the guidelines provided in [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Additionally, if your change impacts performance, include relevant information, such as benchmark data. The [`benchstat`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat) tool is commonly used for describing changes that affect performance.

Following these steps ensures a smoother and more organized contribution process to the `bat` project.
